How to handle subqueries in a FROM
- reasons to use a modal window:
	names introduced are not accessible outside the subquery
	simply because there is a subquery: Diane not sure would want a modal window
		in this case, but it doesn't seem possible to have a subquery introduce
		names that continue to exist when it's done
- hypothesis: names introduced in a subquery in a FROM
  are not accessible outside the subquery
	Confirm this
- in that case, use a modal window

Renames
- example:
	SELECT xxx 
	FROM Offering O1
	WHERE ....
  can you then refer to Offering.oid?  Postgres says no.
- therefore namespace should only show O1, not Offering

Non-correlated subqueries in a WHERE
- rethought tentative decisions from previous meeting with Sophia
- don't want to expand the subquery in the TOC because we want it
  to look like a subquery in its own namespace
- came up with a new possible design (whiteboard)

Subqueries in a select
- confirm that psql does not support it
- Katherine thinks it does

Subqueries with union, etc.
- analogous to subquery in WHERE
	- x.1 is first subquery -- creates a modal window
	
Distinct
- make it a substep of select

Decision
- restrict visualizer to single-column subqueries in where clauses

LIMIT
- treat it as a separate step
- okay to not handle LIMIT

IMPORTANT
- keep a list of all limitations in the visualizer

Update on the SQL Parser
- handles
	subqueries, having, group by, order by, set ops
- still working on
	order of operations and use of brackets
- compound statements separated by semicolon: 
  DMASK removes comments and breaks input down into single statements
  before passing it on. 	
- make sure that throughout, any errors throw an exception
- add code that handles all possible exceptions:
	try running the query in psql
	if it runs:
		report "can't visualize this, but here's the result:"
	else:
		report "invalid query; here's the psql error:"

Going from AST to PQO lists: Martin
- just getting started

TODOs
- confirm things above
- complete test cases that K started for aggregation, group-by, and having
	need the json output specified
- Sophia to figure out UI for these
- completing the other test cases in progress (from Diane's recent email)
